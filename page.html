Joseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski;[1]:11–12 Berdichev, Imperial Russia, 3 December 1857&#160;– 3 August 1924, Bishopsbourne, Kent, England) was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. He was granted British nationality in 1886, but always considered himself a Pole.[note 1] Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English,[2] though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties (and always with a marked accent). He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent universe. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English[note 2] tragic sensibility into English literature.[3]
While some of his works have a strain of romanticism, his works are viewed as modernist literature. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including D. H. Lawrence, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[4] William Faulkner,[4] Ernest Hemingway,[5] George Orwell,[6]:254 Graham Greene,[4] Malcolm Lowry, William Golding,[4] William S. Burroughs, Joseph Heller, Italo Calvino, Gabriel García Márquez,[4] J. G. Ballard, John le Carré,[4] V.S. Naipaul,[4] Philip Roth,[7] Hunter S. Thompson, J.M. Coetzee[4] and Salman Rushdie.[note 3]
